# react-crud-demo

A simple task-list crud demo app featuring react + web api (.NET Core)

This is a simple demo application featuring:

- Pesistence layer (Microsoft SQL Server)
- Web API (.NET Core)
- UI (React)

It can serve as a quick demo application.

# Prerequisites

To build and run, you'll need the following tools:

## Microsoft SQL Server

I used the Express edition as its free.

## Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

This was required to create the back-end database, as well as to view the data. I used version 18.

## .NET Core SDK

I've used v3.1.8.

## Node / NPM

The Node / NPM stack needs to be installed to develop the react front-end.

## VSCode

I've used VSCode as the editor. VSCode now supports workspaces meaning you can open the API project and the react project as if one solution.

# Design

The application is a simple to-do list and allows a user to manage a list of 'tasks'. It will allow a user to:

- View a list of tasks
- Add a task
- Edit a task
- Delete a task
- Mark a task as complete

Each task will have the following attributes:

- ID (integer) - this will be auto-generated by the database
- Description - A description of the task
- Priority - The task priority from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest)
- DueDate - The date that the task is due
- IsComplete - A boolean flag which is set to true when the task is complete

## URLs

The API will implement the following endpoints:

| Method | Url                 | Action                      |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| GET    | /tasks              | Gets a list of tasks        |
| GET    | /tasks/:id          | Gets a single task by `:id` |
| POST   | /tasks              | Creates a new task          |
| PUT    | /tasks/:id          | Updates a task by `:id`     |
| DELETE | /tasks/:id          | Deletes a task by `:id`     |
| PUT    | /tasks/complete/:id | Completes a task by `:id`   |

# Database

The database should be named `react-crud-demo`. I created this manually using SSMS. The `Task` table can then be created with the following script:

```sql
USE [react-crud-demo]
GO

/****** Object:  Table [dbo].[Task]    Script Date: 22/10/2020 12:08:43 PM ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO

SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Task](
	[TaskId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[TaskDescription] [varchar](1000) NOT NULL,
	[TaskPriority] [tinyint] NOT NULL,
	[TaskDue] [date] NOT NULL,
	[TaskComplete] [bit] NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED
(
	[TaskId] ASC
)WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON, OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
```

# API

The API project was bootstrapped using the following command:

`dotnet new webapi -n react-crud-demo-api`

The API project was added to a new workspace in VSCode (so we can open both the API and UI project later in the same VSCode environment).

Initial references added:

```
dotnet add package dapper
dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient
```

## Connection Strings

The database connection string was added into appsettings.json, and injected into the code using the `IOptions` pattern. This involved:

- Adding the connection string into appsettings.json
- Creating a `ConnectionStringConfig` class to represent the configuration
- Registering the `ConnectionStringConfig` class as a service in the `StartUp.cs` file
- Adding an `IOptions<ConnectionStringConfig>` parameter on the controller constructor

## Adding Swagger / Swashbuckle

For improved testing / documentation of the API, it's a good idea to add in Swagger support. This can be done by installing the Swashbuckle package:

`dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`

and adding the Swashbuckle generator to the `services` collection in the `StartUp.ConfigureServices` method.

```cs
services.AddSwaggerGen();
```

and enabling middleware support for serving the generated JSON document and the Swagger UI by adding code to the `Configure` method.

```cs
app.UseSwagger();

...

app.UseSwaggerUI(c => {c.SwaggerEndPoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json","react-crud-demo")});
```

## Launch Profiles

A Development profile was edited in the LaunchSettings.json file. http schema was defined here (port 5000).

## Building the API project

`dotnet build`

## Running the API project

To run the API using the Development profile, run:

`dotnet run --launch-profile Development`

Then open browser, and navigate to http://localhost:5000/swagger

If everything builds and runs correctly, you should see something like this on the swagger homepage:

![react-crud-demo-swagger](https://github.com/davidbarone/react-crud-demo/blob/main/images/swagger.png?raw=true)

# UI

The UI is built using React. The boilerplate code was created using:

`npx create-react-app react-crud-demo-ui`

## React Folder Structure

All the components, utils and other dynamic files go into the /src folder. This involved a small rearrangement of files. In particular the default `App` component was moved into a new /app folder within a new /components folder within /src. All the components are to go into separate folders in /components for a cleaner code structure.

In summary, static files go into the /public folder, and dynamic webpack files go into the /src folder.

## React Router

React-router-dom was installed via:

`npm i react-router-dom`.

The router was implemented as follows:
- Created `Home` and `About` components
- Added a `Router` component in the `App` component. This:
  - Displays a custom `NavBar` component
  - Added multiple `Route` components to redirect based on the route selected.
